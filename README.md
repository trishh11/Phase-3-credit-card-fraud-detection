# AI-Powered Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## Overview

This project focuses on developing an AI-powered system to accurately detect and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions in real time. By analyzing user behavior and transaction patterns, this system aims to overcome the limitations of traditional fraud detection methods, which are often slow and inaccurate.

This project is part of the Phase-3 submission for [mention the course or program if applicable].

## Problem Statement

Credit card fraud poses a significant threat to digital transactions, leading to substantial financial losses. Existing fraud detection systems often struggle with the increasing sophistication of fraudulent activities, resulting in false alerts and a compromised user experience.

## Proposed Solution

This project proposes an AI-driven solution that utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze transaction data, identify unusual behavior, and detect potential fraud in real time. The system learns from historical patterns and continuously updates its detection model to improve accuracy and reduce false positives.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following key components:

* **[Likely Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation]**
* **[Potentially a Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and model development]**
* **[Any data files used for training and testing (if publicly available or simulated)]**
* **[Documentation files, including this README]**
* **[Potentially model serialization files (e.g., using joblib)]**

## Code Description

The project includes code for:

* **Data Cleaning:** Preprocessing transaction data by handling missing values and removing irrelevant features (as seen with the `Churn_Modelling.csv` example).
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data patterns and understanding the distribution of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
* **Feature Engineering:** Transforming raw data into features suitable for machine learning models, such as one-hot encoding categorical variables.
* **Model Development:** Implementing and training machine learning models (the provided snippets show the import of `RandomForestClassifier` and `LogisticRegression`).
* **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the trained model using metrics like classification reports and confusion matrices.
* **Model Persistence:** Saving the trained model for future use (using `joblib`).

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/sruthiofficial/phase-3-credit-card-detection.git](https://github.com/sruthiofficial/phase-3-credit-card-detection.git)
    cd phase-3-credit-card-detection
    ```

2.  **Install required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # Create this file with necessary libraries
    ```
    *(Note: You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file listing libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly)*

3.  **[Provide any specific instructions on how to run the code, e.g., running a main Python script or Jupyter Notebook.]**

## Usage

[Provide instructions on how to use the system, such as providing input data and interpreting the output.]

## Future Scope

This project can be further enhanced by exploring the following:

1.  Real-time deep learning for dynamic fraud detection.
2.  Federated learning for privacy-preserving training.
3.  Adaptive models that learn new fraud patterns continuously.
4.  Behavioral biometrics for enhanced user verification.
5.  Graph analytics to detect fraud networks.
6.  Explainable AI to build user trust.
7.  Blockchain for secure, traceable transactions.
